# Symph Engineering Standards

## About

This document is the core repository for standards and guidelines specific to software development at Symph. It sets forth the criteria and practices that govern our software development processes, ensuring consistency, quality, and efficiency across all projects. These standards apply to every member of our development teams, including full-time staff, contractors, and partners.

Compliance with these standards is mandatory for all software development activities within Symph. Exceptions to these standards can only be made through a formal review and approval process aligned with Symph's architectural governance framework.

## Principles
