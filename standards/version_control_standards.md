## Contributing

### 1. Create a branch off of latest development branch (usually `development`)

Name the branch using the following guidelines:

- `feature/branch-name` - For code that adds features. May include tests.
- `fix/branch-name` - For code that fixes a broken feature.
- `fixtest/branch-name` - For code that fixes a broken test.
- `misc/branch-name` - For code clean up and refactoring changes that don't fix bugs or add new features.
- `test/branch-name` - For code that only adds tests.
- `adjustment/branch-name` - For code that changes an existing working feature.

### 2. Do your stuff

Make commits according to its purpose. For example, if you are building a new feature, don't do code cleanup. Do code cleanup in a separate commit (or better, a separate branch)

Commit message template: `[Commit Type][Author] Add user login`

**Commit types:**

- Feature
- Fix
- Fix Test
- Misc
- Test
- Adjustment

### 3. Push to Github often. Rebase often.

Pushing and pulling often reduce the chance of conflicts and being out of sync. Try to do this a few times a day.

### 4. When ready, create a Pull Request from your branch to the latest dev branch (ie. `development`).

Tag the reviewers to review your PR. Mention the reviewers in Discord along with a link to your PR.

### 5. Respond to or address reviewers' feedback to your PR.

Be receptive to feedback, keep an open mind, and always assume positive intent. ‚ù§Ô∏è

### 6. Merge when approved üéâ
