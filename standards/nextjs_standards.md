# Next.js Standards

# Style Guide

This style guide provides a comprehensive overview of best practices, coding standards, and recommendations for working with Next.js. It aims to help developers write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## General Principles

- **Consistency**: Ensure consistency across your codebase in formatting, naming conventions, and file structure.
- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand, with meaningful variable and function names.
- **Simplicity**: Keep solutions simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency, considering the performance implications of your code.

## Writing

- Write clear, concise sentences and avoid tangents.
- Use simple words; for example, use "use" instead of "utilize".
- Use an active voice for readability.
- Avoid subjective words like "easy", "quick", "simple", "just", etc.
- Write in the second person (you/your) and use gender-neutral language.
- Ensure code examples are properly formatted and working2.

## Code Formatting

- Use Prettier for automatic code formatting to maintain consistency.
- Configure ESLint with Next.js specific rules to catch common issues and enforce style guidelines.
- Adopt a consistent indentation method (e.g., 2 spaces) across the project.

## Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use PascalCase for files (e.g., `MyComponent.ts`).
- **Directories**: Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., `my-directory`).
- **Components**: Use PascalCase for React components (e.g., `UserProfile.js`).
- **Variables and Functions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `getUserData`).

## File Structure & Naming Convention

- Organize project files under the `src` directory for clarity.
- Use the `pages` directory for page components, leveraging Next.js's file-based routing.
- Store static assets in the `public` directory.
- Group components into a `components` directory, categorizing further if necessary.

## Component Structure

Use atomic design when organizing components. Organize components into atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates for scalability and maintainability.

## Efficient Code Splitting, Dynamic Imports, and Loading of Client-Side Scripts

- Leverage Next.js's built-in code splitting to manage application code in smaller, more manageable units.
- Utilize dynamic imports for loading non-essential components on demand, reducing the initial bundle size and improving page load times.
- Identify components or code segments not critical for the initial page load and load them asynchronously.

## Rendering Modes

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Use for pages requiring dynamic content or SEO, ideal for public-facing and content-heavy pages.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Use for content with infrequent changes, suitable for landing pages, blogs, and marketing sites.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Use for interactive components and real-time data, prioritizing pages/components that require interactivity.
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Combine SSR and CSR benefits for applications with mixed content and interactivity needs.

## Styling

- Utilize CSS Modules for component-level styles to avoid conflicts.
- Consider CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components for dynamic styling.
- Use the `Image` component from `next/image` for optimized image handling.
- Use utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

## Accessibility

- Follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure your application is accessible.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Test accessibility with tools and aim for keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.

## Performance Optimization

- Optimize images and leverage Next.js's image optimization.
- Use static generation (SSG) where possible for faster page loads.
- Analyze and optimize bundle sizes with Next.js's built-in analytics.

## Security Practices

- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information.
- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Testing

- Write unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
- Aim for a high coverage to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Documentation

- Document components and functions clearly, providing examples where necessary.
- Maintain a README file with project setup instructions and other essential information.

By adhering to these guidelines, developers can ensure that their Next.js projects are well-organized, maintainable, and scalable. Adapt these recommendations based on specific project needs and preferences.
